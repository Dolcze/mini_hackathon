Project fot the Mini_hackathon  /theme=recycling

Project is a site prototype, it uses one python script for decoding barcode images. Then it searches DataBase specified in inc/db.inc.php for match, if the DB has no info, it asks user for info about the package and in which recycle bin type it belongs. Saves to DB.

Currently using xamp as a database but it's hostable on AWS or other cloud. (of course you can host it locally but the security measures have to be tighten)

dependencies: 
pyzbar module
opencv-python module
mysqli ext
microsoft visual framework 2013


1. You can;t upload an image if the name is already taken, you have to either remove image, change image name or delete the old one. Shouldn't be an issue when user connects thru mobile phone. It's mainly an issue when testing - solvable
FOR MORE ctrl+f in functions.inc.py : // FILE NAME HANDLING PROBLEM


2. Security issues e.g: (for example) 
- no ht.ascess
- visible file names
- is db secure?

3. inform user about cookies?

4. Tweak main.py so it decodes recognizes barcodes better,

5. Polish signs when uploading to db? (input.php)

6. Front-end needs to be finished, dispaly css for every page, include footer and header for every page, simple stuff but time consuming.

7.  ssl certificate when setting up on a server
